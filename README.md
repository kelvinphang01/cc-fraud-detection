Assignment for IST3244:

**Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**

A credit card fraud transaction detection model using Python.

Random Forest and XGBoost models with different class weights are trained.

Derived features and implemented cost-based learning strategies.

Models are finally evaluated on the savings by calculating the detected fraud amount and the associated costs for false detections.

Achieved a 90.3% reduction in fraudulent transaction amounts and a net savings of 82.6%.
